# About the app

This is a clock that works on the principle of intervals. Every 25 minutes of work, a five-minute break will start.

** In other applications I used React or React-Redux, in this application I decided to practice with the jQuery library

## How should I interract with this app?

By default, working time lasts 25 minutes, break lasts 5 minutes. You can use the up and down arrows to change these default values.
By pressing the "start" icon, the timer will start, you can pause the timer, or watch all settings up to the standard ones, in this case the timer will also be stopped.
